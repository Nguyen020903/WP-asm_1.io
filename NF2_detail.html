                    <h2>How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States</h2>
                    <p>Named one of the ten best books of the year by the Chicago Tribune
                        A Publishers Weekly best book of 2019 A 2019 NPR Staff Pick

                        A pathbreaking history of the United States' overseas possessions and the true meaning of its
                        empire

                        We are familiar with maps that outline all fifty states. And we are also familiar with the idea
                        that the United States is an "empire," exercising power around the world. But what about the
                        actual territories--the islands, atolls, and archipelagos--this country has governed and
                        inhabited?
                        In How to Hide an Empire, Daniel Immerwahr tells the fascinating story of the United States
                        outside the United States. In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that
                        cast American history in a new light. We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors
                        collected one of the nineteenth century's most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site
                        of the most destructive event on U.S. soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr shows how U.S. doctors
                        conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the
                        emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the U.S. Congress.
                        In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism.
                        Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new
                        sort of influence that did not require the control of colonies. Rich with absorbing vignettes,
                        full of surprises, and driven by an original conception of what empire and globalization mean
                        today, How to Hide an Empire is a major and compulsively readable work of history.</p>
