                    <h2>Wildfire</h2>
                    <p>Newbery Honor author Rodman Philbrick sends readers straight into the nightmare of a raging
                        wildfire as 12-year-old Sam is trapped by explosive flames and deadly smoke that threaten to
                        take his life. Can he survive?
                        Flames race toward Sam Castine's summer camp as evacuation buses are loading, but Sam runs back
                        to get his phone. Suddenly, a flash of heat blasts him as pine trees explode. Now a wall of fire
                        separates Sam from his bus, and there's only one thing to do: Run for his life. Run or die.

                        Lungs burning, Sam's only goal is to keep moving. Drought has made the forest a tinderbox, and
                        Sam struggles to remember survival tricks he learned from his late father. Then, when he least
                        expects it, he encounters Delphy, an older girl who is also lost. Their unlikely friendship
                        grows as they join forces to find civilization.

                        The pace never slows, and eventually flames surround Sam and Delphy on all sides. A powerful
                        bond is forged that can only grow out of true hardship -- as two true friends beat all odds and
                        outwit one of the deadliest fires ever.

                        At the end of the novel, information about wildfires and useful safety tips add to the reader's
                        understanding of one of the world's most dangerous natural disasters.</p>
