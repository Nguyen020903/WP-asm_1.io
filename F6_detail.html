                        "A mini-masterpiece of portal fantasy -- a jewel of a book that deserves to be shelved with
                        Lewis Carroll's and C. S. Lewis' classics" --NPR
                        Eleanor West's Home for Wayward Children
                        No Solicitations
                        No Visitors
                        No Quests
                        Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under
                        a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging
                        somewhere... else.
                        But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.
                        Nancy tumbled once, but now she's back. The things she's experienced... they change a person.
                        The children under Miss West's care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way
                        back to their own fantasy world.
                        But Nancy's arrival marks a change at the Home. There's a darkness just around each corner, and
                        when tragedy strikes, it's up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of
                        things.
                        No matter the cost.

                        PRAISE FOR EVERY HEART A DOORWAY
                        "Seanan McGuire has long been one of the smartest writers around, and with this novella we can
                        easily see that her heart is as big as her brain. We know this story isn't true, but it is
                        truth." -- Charlaine Harris, New York Times bestselling author of the Sookie Stackhouse series
                        (TV's True Blood)
                        "Every Heart a Doorway by Seanan McGuire is one of the most extraordinary stories I've ever
                        read." -- V. E. Schwab, New York Times bestselling author of The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue
                        "Seanan McGuire once again demonstrates her intimate knowledge of the human heart in a powerful
                        fable of loss, yearning and damaged children." -- Paul Cornell, author of London Falling and
                        Witches of Lychford
                        "So mindblowingly good, it hurts." -- io9
                        "With Every Heart a Doorway, McGuire has created her own mini-masterpiece of portal fantasy -- a
                        jewel of a book that deserves to be shelved with Lewis Carroll's and C. S. Lewis' classics, even
                        as it carves its own precocious space between them." -- NPR</p>
