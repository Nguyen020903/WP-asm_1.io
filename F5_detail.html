                    <h2>The Lighthouse Witches</h2>
                    <p>A Most Anticipated Novel by Pop Sugar * Book Riot * Betches * Bustle * and more!
                        "Utterly spellbinding....Witchcraft meets thriller."--Pop Sugar
                        Two sisters go missing on a remote Scottish island. Twenty years later, one is found--but she's
                        still the same age as when she disappeared. The secrets of witches have reached across the
                        centuries in this chilling Gothic thriller from the author of the acclaimed The Nesting.
                        When single mother Liv is commissioned to paint a mural in a 100-year-old lighthouse on a remote
                        Scottish island, it's an opportunity to start over with her three daughters--Luna, Sapphire, and
                        Clover. When two of her daughters go missing, she's frantic. She learns that the cave beneath
                        the lighthouse was once a prison for women accused of witchcraft. The locals warn her about
                        wildlings, supernatural beings who mimic human children, created by witches for revenge. Liv is
                        told wildlings are dangerous and must be killed.
                        Twenty-two years later, Luna has been searching for her missing sisters and mother. When she
                        receives a call about her youngest sister, Clover, she's initially ecstatic. Clover is the
                        sister she remembers--except she's still seven years old, the age she was when she vanished.
                        Luna is worried Clover is a wildling. Luna has few memories of her time on the island, but
                        she'll have to return to find the truth of what happened to her family. But she doesn't realize
                        just how much the truth will change her.</p>
