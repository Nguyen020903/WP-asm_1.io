                        In this magical middle-grade debut novel from Adrianna Cuevas, The Total Eclipse of Nestor
                        Lopez, a Cuban American boy must use his secret ability to communicate with animals to save the
                        inhabitants of his town when they are threatened by a tule vieja, a witch that transforms into
                        animals.

                        All Nestor Lopez wants is to live in one place for more than a few months and have dinner with
                        his dad.
                        When he and his mother move to a new town to live with his grandmother after his dad's latest
                        deployment, Nestor plans to lay low. He definitely doesn't want to anyone find out his deepest
                        secret: that he can talk to animals.
                        But when the animals in his new town start disappearing, Nestor's grandmother becomes the prime
                        suspect after she is spotted in the woods where they were last seen. As Nestor investigates the
                        source of the disappearances, he learns that they are being seized by a tule vieja--a witch who
                        can absorb an animal's powers by biting it during a solar eclipse. And the next eclipse is just
                        around the corner...
                        Now it's up to Nestor's extraordinary ability and his new friends to catch the tule vieja--and
                        save a place he might just call home.</p>
