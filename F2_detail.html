                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - The award-winning, best-selling author of Station Eleven and The
                        Glass Hotel returns with a novel of art, time travel, love, and plague that takes the reader
                        from Vancouver Island in 1912 to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a
                        story of humanity across centuries and space.
                        One of the Best Books of the Year: The New York Times, NPR, GoodReads
                        "One of [Mandel's] finest novels and one of her most satisfying forays into the arena of
                        speculative fiction yet." --The New York Times
                        Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from
                        polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest,
                        spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin
                        echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his core.
                        Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all
                        over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and
                        artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange
                        passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the
                        trees of a forest rise around him.
                        When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate
                        an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled
                        son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth,
                        and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to
                        do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe.
                        A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of
                        Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our
                        current moment.</p>
